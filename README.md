# TodoApp



This is a todo app inspired by todoMVC. However, this has been written from scratch with the help of bootstrap and Angular Material.

You can:<br>
a) Add items to todo list<br>
b) Reorder them according to your priority (Drag and drop).<br>
c) Mark them as complete.<br>
d) Delete items from list<br>
